      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Kerwin Xiang Liao is a PhD candidate in Business Administration at the University of South Carolina. He is a theory-driven scholar whose research lies at the intersection of strategic cognition and organization theory. He examines how organizations and individuals interpret contested meanings and navigate moral, institutional, and cognitive complexity in dynamic environments.

His work focuses on how meaning structures emerge, stabilize, and are strategically reframed in response to shifting conditions—such as corporate moral conflict and political uncertainty. Across projects, he explores how individual-level cognition aggregates into organizational learning and systemic adaptation by combining theory building, simulation modeling, and both qualitative and empirical methods.
