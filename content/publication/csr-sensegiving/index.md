abstract: Firms seeking to balance profitability and prosocial responsibility often face a dilemma when institutional expectations around corporate social responsibility (CSR) shift. Structural efforts to demonstrate commitment to CSR may enhance legitimacy and stakeholder trust, yet the substantive impact of such efforts remains debated. This study theorizes that organizational structuring—through the creation of formal roles, routines, and governance bodies—enables firms to engage in credible sensegiving that aligns prosocial intent with financial outcomes. Drawing on a longitudinal case study of Panasonic’s supply chain CSR initiatives, we trace how the firm evolved from a compliance-oriented stance to a strategic narrative of innovation and resilience. We further argue that the performance benefits of CSR depend not on the volume of initiatives but on how these initiatives are structurally embedded within the organization. We test this proposition with a large-scale panel analysis of Japanese firms and find that CSR structuring, rather than activity count, is positively associated with subsequent financial performance. Our findings contribute to research on CSR, sensegiving, and organizational design by showing how firms navigate institutional complexity through structured meaning-making. We also extend theory by highlighting how culturally embedded norms shape the form and function of CSR in practice.
