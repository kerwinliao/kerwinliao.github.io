abstract: This study examines the relationship between corporate political connections (CPCs) and firm R&D investments, focusing on the individual-level characteristics of politically connected individuals. Departing from prior research that assumes uniform effects of politically connected individuals, this study argues that personal backgrounds significantly influence decisions on corporate innovation investments. Using panel data from 2004 to 2019 for Chinese publicly listed firms, time-fixed effects regression models reveal how attributes such as age, tenure, education, and political affiliations shape R&D investments. Older politically connected individuals positively influence R&D investments, while the amount of formal education is associated with reduced R&D investments. The number of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members negatively correlates with innovation investments, reflecting unique cognitive bases in absorbing information and compliance-driven priorities. In contrast, the number of politically connected independent board members positively affects R&D spending by reinforcing its long-term scope for shareholders. These findings contribute to the CPC literature by highlighting individual heterogeneity and advance microfoundations research for the origin and nature of collective action by exploring how CPCs shape innovation. Implications for practitioners and policymakers are discussed, along with directions for future research on political connections and firm performance.
