      title: 'üîç My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I am drawn to questions that resist quick answers‚Äîthose that unfold through ambiguity, contradiction, and quiet resistance.

        I believe that understanding organizations begins with understanding how people search for meaning when the world stops making sense, and how heterogeneous forms of cognition shape that search.
        
        I work with deliberate care, seeking ideas that are both structurally precise and deeply human.

        If we accept only what we can predict as knowledge, then we must erase the legacy of Max Weber, discard the paradigm shifts of Thomas Kuhn, and silence the insights of Carl Jung and Friedrich Nietzsche.
        
        But we haven‚Äôt‚Äîbecause we know that knowledge is not only about accuracy, but about meaning. And organization theory is where meaning finds structure.
