Below is the table showing 8 cognitive functions of an INTJ in the order of their **function stack (dominant, auxiliary, tertiary, and inferior)** and the *shadow functions* that are less conscious but still play a role. (*Generated from ChatGPT* )

Order | Function | Explanation
--- | --- | --- 
1. Dominant | Introverted Intuition (Ni) | INTJs excel at seeing patterns, future possibilities, and making connections between seemingly unrelated ideas. This function drives their vision and foresight.
2. Auxiliary | Extraverted Thinking (Te) | Logical and efficient decision-making, focusing on organizing external systems, achieving goals, and implementing strategies effectively.
3. Tertiary | Introverted Feeling (Fi) | Internal value system that helps INTJs evaluate situations based on personal ethics, values, and authenticity, though it may not always be expressed outwardly.
4. Inferior | Extraverted Sensing (Se) | Awareness of the physical world, details, and sensory experiences. Often underdeveloped, INTJs may struggle with living in the moment or sensory indulgence.
5. Opposing | Extraverted Intuition (Ne) | A shadow function, it explores multiple possibilities but may feel less natural. INTJs may experience it as skepticism about new or divergent ideas.
6. Critical Parent | Introverted Thinking (Ti) | Used in a critical way, this shadow function may cause INTJs to overanalyze or second-guess the logical consistency of their own or others’ systems.
7. Trickster | Extraverted Feeling (Fe) | Often experienced as a blind spot, INTJs may struggle with understanding or expressing social harmony and external emotional dynamics.
8. Demon | Introverted Sensing (Si) | The least conscious function, it can manifest as resistance to routine or over-reliance on past experiences, often leading to stress or frustration.

**More detailed explanation**

Order | Function | Manifestation | Strengths | Weaknesses | Beneficial for Development | Challenges in Development
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1. Dominant | Introverted Intuition (Ni) | Prefers deep thinking, sees patterns, future possibilities, and makes connections between ideas. | Visionary thinking; excels in abstract problem-solving and foresight. | Overlooks immediate details or practical concerns; dismisses alternative perspectives. | Fields requiring strategy, innovation, and abstract thinking (e.g., research, management, entrepreneurship). | Living in the moment or adapting to unanticipated events.
2. Auxiliary | Extraverted Thinking (Te) | Drives goal-oriented actions, organizes systems, and measures success through tangible results. | Strong leadership and execution skills; solves real-world problems efficiently. | Prioritizes efficiency over emotional considerations; can seem blunt or dismissive. | Implementing visionary ideas (Ni) into concrete outcomes. | Emotionally charged situations or collaboration requiring high empathy.
3. Tertiary | Introverted Feeling (Fi) | Guides personal values and authenticity; develops a strong internal moral compass. | Helps INTJs stay true to their values; fosters introspection and emotional understanding. | Struggles to articulate emotions; may seem cold or stubborn when values are challenged. | Encourages emotional growth and deeper self-awareness. | Balancing Fi with Te for values-driven yet practical decisions.
4. Inferior | Extraverted Sensing (Se) | Awareness of sensory details and immediate experiences; source of joy in physical activities or aesthetics. | Grounds INTJs in the present; enhances appreciation for art, beauty, and physical challenges. | Underdeveloped; may lead to overindulgence or ignoring physical environments. | Practicing mindfulness; engaging in hobbies like cooking, gardening, or sports. | Prioritizing abstract thinking over physical awareness; requires deliberate effort.
5. Opposing | Extraverted Intuition (Ne) | Explores alternative possibilities but often critically; can encourage creativity or skepticism. | Promotes adaptability and brainstorming; challenges rigid perspectives. | Leads to overthinking or dismissing new ideas prematurely. | Embracing Ne can make INTJs more flexible and open to unconventional ideas. | Tends to surface under stress, making it harder to consciously develop.
6. Critical Parent | Introverted Thinking (Ti) | Focuses on internal logical consistency; often used to analyze and refine ideas under pressure. | Adds depth to logical analysis and problem-solving; useful for troubleshooting. | Can lead to over-analysis or perfectionism. | Enhances intellectual rigor and precision. | Feels draining and less natural than Te.
7. Trickster | Extraverted Feeling (Fe) | Relates to external emotional harmony but feels unnatural; may manifest as sarcasm or misunderstanding. | Encourages consideration of others’ emotional needs. | Struggles with empathy or group dynamics; prone to misreading social cues. | Improves interpersonal relationships and teamwork. | Triggered when emotions are expected to take precedence over logic.
8. Demon | Introverted Sensing (Si) | Deals with memory, routine, and traditions; often a source of stress or frustration. | Grounds through lessons from past experiences; helps balance innovation with respect for history. | Feels stuck in outdated patterns; may resist repetitive tasks or traditions. | Reflecting on Si helps integrate past experiences into present actions. | Surfaces in extreme stress or frustration; feels unnatural.
