Below is the table showing 8 cognitive functions of an INTJ in the order of their **function stack (dominant, auxiliary, tertiary, and inferior)** and the *shadow functions* that are less conscious but still play a role. (*Generated from ChatGPT* )

Order | Function | Explanation
--- | --- | --- 
1. Dominant | Introverted Intuition (Ni) | INTJs excel at seeing patterns, future possibilities, and making connections between seemingly unrelated ideas. This function drives their vision and foresight.
2. Auxiliary | Extraverted Thinking (Te) | Logical and efficient decision-making, focusing on organizing external systems, achieving goals, and implementing strategies effectively.
3. Tertiary | Introverted Feeling (Fi) | Internal value system that helps INTJs evaluate situations based on personal ethics, values, and authenticity, though it may not always be expressed outwardly.
4. Inferior | Extraverted Sensing (Se) | Awareness of the physical world, details, and sensory experiences. Often underdeveloped, INTJs may struggle with living in the moment or sensory indulgence.
5. Opposing | Extraverted Intuition (Ne) | A shadow function, it explores multiple possibilities but may feel less natural. INTJs may experience it as skepticism about new or divergent ideas.
6. Critical Parent | Introverted Thinking (Ti) | Used in a critical way, this shadow function may cause INTJs to overanalyze or second-guess the logical consistency of their own or others’ systems.
7. Trickster | Extraverted Feeling (Fe) | Often experienced as a blind spot, INTJs may struggle with understanding or expressing social harmony and external emotional dynamics.
8. Demon | Introverted Sensing (Si) | The least conscious function, it can manifest as resistance to routine or over-reliance on past experiences, often leading to stress or frustration.

**More detailed explanation**

Order | Function | Manifestation | Strengths | Weaknesses | Beneficial for Development | Challenges in Development
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1. Dominant | Introverted Intuition (Ni) | Prefers deep thinking, sees patterns, future possibilities, and makes connections between ideas. | Visionary thinking; excels in abstract problem-solving and foresight. | Overlooks immediate details or practical concerns; dismisses alternative perspectives. | Fields requiring strategy, innovation, and abstract thinking (e.g., research, management, entrepreneurship). | Living in the moment or adapting to unanticipated events.
2. Auxiliary | Extraverted Thinking (Te) | Drives goal-oriented actions, organizes systems, and measures success through tangible results. | Strong leadership and execution skills; solves real-world problems efficiently. | Prioritizes efficiency over emotional considerations; can seem blunt or dismissive. | Implementing visionary ideas (Ni) into concrete outcomes. | Emotionally charged situations or collaboration requiring high empathy.
3. Tertiary | Introverted Feeling (Fi) | Guides personal values and authenticity; develops a strong internal moral compass. | Helps INTJs stay true to their values; fosters introspection and emotional understanding. | Struggles to articulate emotions; may seem cold or stubborn when values are challenged. | Encourages emotional growth and deeper self-awareness. | Balancing Fi with Te for values-driven yet practical decisions.
4. Inferior | Extraverted Sensing (Se) | Awareness of sensory details and immediate experiences; source of joy in physical activities or aesthetics. | Grounds INTJs in the present; enhances appreciation for art, beauty, and physical challenges. | Underdeveloped; may lead to overindulgence or ignoring physical environments. | Practicing mindfulness; engaging in hobbies like cooking, gardening, or sports. | Prioritizing abstract thinking over physical awareness; requires deliberate effort.
5. Opposing | Extraverted Intuition (Ne) | Explores alternative possibilities but often critically; can encourage creativity or skepticism. | Promotes adaptability and brainstorming; challenges rigid perspectives. | Leads to overthinking or dismissing new ideas prematurely. | Embracing Ne can make INTJs more flexible and open to unconventional ideas. | Tends to surface under stress, making it harder to consciously develop.
6. Critical Parent | Introverted Thinking (Ti) | Focuses on internal logical consistency; often used to analyze and refine ideas under pressure. | Adds depth to logical analysis and problem-solving; useful for troubleshooting. | Can lead to over-analysis or perfectionism. | Enhances intellectual rigor and precision. | Feels draining and less natural than Te.
7. Trickster | Extraverted Feeling (Fe) | Relates to external emotional harmony but feels unnatural; may manifest as sarcasm or misunderstanding. | Encourages consideration of others’ emotional needs. | Struggles with empathy or group dynamics; prone to misreading social cues. | Improves interpersonal relationships and teamwork. | Triggered when emotions are expected to take precedence over logic.
8. Demon | Introverted Sensing (Si) | Deals with memory, routine, and traditions; often a source of stress or frustration. | Grounds through lessons from past experiences; helps balance innovation with respect for history. | Feels stuck in outdated patterns; may resist repetitive tasks or traditions. | Reflecting on Si helps integrate past experiences into present actions. | Surfaces in extreme stress or frustration; feels unnatural.

### **Strengths and Weaknesses for an INTJ to be successful in academia/research-based career path**

Aspect of PhD Program | How INTJ Excels
--- | ---
Research and Original Thinking | 1. Ni: Generates innovative research questions and uncovers patterns in complex data.
 | 2.  Te: Organizes research into logical, actionable frameworks and pursues goals efficiently.
Independence in Study | Prefers self-directed work and thrives in environments that require autonomy.
Theoretical and Conceptual Focus | Enjoys diving into abstract concepts and building models or theories (e.g., organization theory, strategic frameworks).
Problem-Solving in Management | Combines Ni and Te to propose practical solutions to real-world management challenges.
Quantitative and Analytical Skills | Uses structured thinking to handle empirical analysis and computational simulations, as in agent-based or NK models.
Commitment to Long-Term Goals | Demonstrates perseverance and discipline, essential for completing a multi-year program.
Focus on Strategic Research Areas | Excels in areas like innovation, technology, and industry evolution, aligning with management and strategy research.


#### **When INTJ Performs Well**

- **Developing Research Questions:**
	- INTJs' dominant Ni allows them to envision novel and impactful research areas.
	- Example: Identifying how emerging technologies reshape creative industries and organizational structures.

- **Designing Methodologies:**
	- Their Te function helps them craft clear, systematic approaches to research.
	- Example: Creating computational models or conducting robust empirical studies to test hypotheses.

- **Collaborating Strategically:**
	- While not naturally inclined to seek social interactions, INTJs can excel in purposeful collaborations.
	- Example: Partnering with interdisciplinary teams to leverage expertise and achieve shared research goals.

- **Balancing Theory and Application:**
	- INTJs can bridge abstract theoretical concepts with practical applications, an asset in management research.
	- Example: Translating findings on industry evolution into actionable insights for entrepreneurs or policymakers.

- **Thriving in Rigorous Environments:**
	- Their natural discipline and intellectual curiosity align with the demands of a PhD program.
	- Example: Sustaining motivation through the challenges of academic publishing or complex dissertation work.


#### **Challenges INTJs May Face and Mitigation Strategies**


Challenge | Why It Happens | Mitigation Strategy
--- | --- | --- 
Over-Focusing on Vision | Ni can lead to tunnel vision, overlooking details. | Regularly seek feedback from advisors to refine research focus and address practical concerns.
Difficulty with Social Dynamics | Fe (trickster function) may hinder networking. | Approach networking as a strategic task; focus on purposeful connections with like-minded peers.

For most of time, INTJs swing between **unhappy** and **not that unhappy**. If they look unhappy, it is quite normal and **please do NOT** take them personally... That is just their daily normal... Actually, they usually think that being unhappy is pretty healthy.

![unhappy](\assets\images\mbti_happy.jpg) 

The reasons why they are unhappy are due to, but not limited to, below several occasions:

- They can do nothing but have to see human beings pushing themselves to the brink of self-destruction. What is worse, sometimes they are even forced to join this crazy trend...
- No substantial and visible progress. They are progressing in some way, but they are always not satisfied with themselves.
- Too much networking. It would be even worse if I have to be friendly to someone who  keeps talking endlessly in a hypocritical way with hubris.
- Cannot see the meaning of what they are doing.
- to be continued...
